# Shark-Tank-2024-DA-SQL
## Project Objective 
I worked on the Shark Tank 2024 dataset that I collected, and wrote several SQL queries to generate insights. While analyzing the data, I applied a variety of advanced SQL techniques such as window functions, joins, CTEs, subqueries, HAVING clauses, GROUP BY, and aggregate functions. This allowed me to extract meaningful patterns and trends from the dataset.
